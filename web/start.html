		<h3>Welcome to the Virtual Ball-Tossing Game, an Interactive Task Used for Mental Visualization!</h3>

		<p>In the upcoming task, we will test the effects of practicing mental visualization on task performance. Thus, we need you to practice your mental visualization skills. We have found that the best way to do this is to have you play an on-line ball tossing game with other participants who are logged on to the system at the same time.</p>

		<p>In a few moments, you will be playing a ball-tossing game with other students over our network. Several universities in the state of Michigan are taking part in a collaborative investigation of the effects of mental visualization on task performance, with high school students participating at several different Universities around the state of Michigan.</p>
		
		<p>The game is very simple. When the ball is tossed to you, simply press either the "1" key to throw to the player on your left or the "2" key for to throw to the player on your right. When the game is over, the experimenter will give you additional instructions.</p>

		<p>What is important is not your ball tossing performance, but that you MENTALLY VISUALIZE the entire experience. Imagine what the others look like. What sort of people are they? Where are you playing? Is it warm and sunny or cold and rainy? Create in your mind a complete mental picture of what might be going on if you were playing this game in real life.</p>
